"""

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

Example :

    1
   / \
  2   2
 / \ / \
3  4 4  3
The above binary tree is symmetric. 
But the following is not:

    1
   / \
  2   2
   \   \
   3    3
Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem
